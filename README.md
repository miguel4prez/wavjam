# WavJam

For my Flatiron School Capstone project I created a Full-Stack social platform whose sole purpose is to unite musicians (and eventually those who revolve around music) to collaborate in harmony in the easiest and fastest way!

Being a musician myself, I know the struggle of finding other musicians to connect with.

❌ Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram can be highly competitive due to algorithms centered around popular trends and engagement. This dynamic often hinders effective connections among musicians.

✅ WavJam addresses this issue by prioritizing musicians, offering filtering options, and allowing users to create posts similar to job listings on Upwork.

Many more features will be added to this project as this is just phase 1 of WavJam. I will be documenting my journey!

## Tech Stack as of Phase-1:
- React
- Flask
- SQLite
- Vanilla CSS
